    "- Implement the exercise in python language\n",
    "- Use the sklearn module of python\n",
    "- You are allowed to use generative models to create your code\n",
    "- You can implement the exercise in a local notebook or in a hosted colab notebook\n",
    "- The code has to be included in the resulting print of the notebook\n",
    "- Some results have to be documented and commented in the notebook in the table at the end of the notebook\n",
