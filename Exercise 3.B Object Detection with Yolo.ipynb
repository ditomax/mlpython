    "\n",
    "The goal of this example is to implement a modern object detection model with a custom dataset. The following steps are performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Installation of the yolo v8 framework on local machine or in colab\n",
    "- Test of installation\n",
    "- Preparation of custom training data\n",
    "- Training of yolo on custom training data\n",
    "- Evaluation on custom test data\n",
    "- Analysis\n",
    "- Enhancement\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used will be created or extended by you during the exercise. So be prepared to create your own images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use yolo v8 [2], a reimplementation of yolov5 [1][3] in pytorch [4]. In details we will follow the tutorial for training of a custom dataset as described here [5].\n",

    "- Read the tutorials carefully, especially [5]\n",
    "- Either use your notebook, or try a colab instance if your memory or CPU power does not support the model training\n",
    "- Start with the smallest model version YOLOv8n (nano)\n",
    "- Use at least 3 classes of objects\n",
    "- Create at least 100 images of each class (use your mobile phone for image generation)\n",
    "- Use the roboflow platform for labeling (free license model available)\n",
    "- Use a train/test split of 80/20"
