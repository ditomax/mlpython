    "# Exercise 3.A MNIST Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Die goal of this exercise is to create a simple image classification network and to work on the improvement of a model and how to debug and check the training data. We start with a simple CNN model for digit classification of the MNIST dataset [1]. This dataset contains 60,000 scans of digits for training and 10,000 scans of digits for validation. A sample consists of 28x28 features with values between 0 and 255, note that the features are inverted. Actually digits are rather dark on a light background. MNIST digits are light on a dark background. This example is partly based on a tutorial by Jason Brownlee [2]. Please follow the instructions in the notebook.\n",

    "- Implement the exercise in **python** language\n",
    "- Use the sklearn, tensorflow AND/OR pytorch modules of python\n",
    "- You are allowed to use generative models to create your code\n",
    "- You can implement the exercise in a local notebook or in a hosted colab notebook\n",
    "- When you are using a local notebook, please create a copy of this notebook with a different name\n",
    "- The code has to be included in the resulting print of the notebook\n",
    "- Some results have to be documented and commented in the notebook in the table at the end of the notebook\n",
    "- In order to support me finding the places where you fulfill the requirements. Please **mark** the code parts that related to a requirement with the **Rx** mark. E.g. **R0 near the download code**."
