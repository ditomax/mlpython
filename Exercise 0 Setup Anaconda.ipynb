    "Anaconda is a software package that combines a full installation of python and essential machine learning packages on a variety of platforms. For a long time it was very costly to get and maintain a complete and functional installation of python. Incompatibilities were to be expected after one or two updates of python modules at the latest. Anaconda solves this problem and offers additional virtual installations. This allows different versions of python and other modules to be installed on the same computer without disturbing each other."
